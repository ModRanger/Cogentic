## Project Overview
Dont find your cofounder, train them. AI Co-Founder for Marketing

 The AI evolves through stages, from raw code to an autonomous agent capable of strategic decision-making, content generation, and user engagement.

## Design Theme
- Dark background with neon accents
- Retro-futuristic Tamagotchi inspiration
- Minimalist yet engaging interface

## Core Features

### 1. The Egg (Landing Page)
- Oversized egg centerpiece with:
  - Subtle pulsing glow animation
  - Neon color palette (suggest: purple, cyan, hot pink)
  - Floating/hovering effect
- Single input field for Twitter handle(make it super user unfriendly to input, i want to make it hard)
- Hidden changelog that appears **after** Twitter handle submission


#### Technical Specifications
- Background: Pure black (#000000)
- Egg dimensions: 60% of viewport height
- Glow effect: CSS box-shadow with multiple layers
- Animation: Subtle breathing effect (3s cycle)

### 2. User Interface Elements
- Twitter handle input field:
  - We can go two routes for the text input:
       a)hard to find/reveal the box (background same color as text box outline or have it load only when somebody scrolls past spot x )
       b)Some Examples https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-worst-input-fields/
         - Success animation triggers changelog reveal
- Changelog:
  - Random position on screen
  - Retro terminal aesthetic
  - Typewriter text effect
Used for countdown, what were doing, etc

##2. Hatchling Stage: Data Input##
	•	Purpose: Enable users to “feed” the AI by providing data for customization.
    Similar to https://elizagen.howieduhzit.best/ 
    We could use their framework and build on their platform
	•	Core Features:
	•	Data Collection Form:
	•	Fields to input goals(limit goals keywords/core functions - Write or research/) keywords, branding preferences, or a sample dataset.
	•	Visual Feedback:
	•	Interactive animation showing the egg cracking or glowing as users input data.
	•	Data Storage:
	•	Backend system to securely store and process the user-provided data.
	•	Acknowledgment:
	•	Confirmation message (e.g., “So you're building a wordsmith?!”).

  3. Juvenile Stage: Bot Interaction
	•	Purpose: Allow users to interact with the AI for basic marketing tasks.
	•	Core Features:Pick 1 of 3 core functions above
	•	Chat Interface:
	•	Simple chatbot to receive prompts like:
	•	“Generate a tweet for [topic].”
	•	“Suggest a marketing idea for [product].”
	•	AI Responses:
	•	Generate short-form content or recommendations using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4 API).
	•	Visual Feedback:
	•	An animated “hatchling” that grows or reacts based on user interaction.
	•	Limitations:
	•	Clearly communicate that the AI is still learning and more features will come in later stages.
## Implementation Guidelines
Here are the implementation guidelines for building the MVP of the AI Co-Founder for Marketing project:

General Principles
	1.	Focus on Simplicity: The MVP should prioritize core functionality over advanced features.
	2.	Iterative Development: Build incrementally, starting with the Egg stage and progressing to Hatchling and Juvenile stages.
	3.	User-Centric Design: Ensure the experience is intuitive and engaging, even in its early stages.
	4.	Scalability: Design the architecture to easily add features in future stages (e.g., Adolescent and Adult).
	5.	Transparency: Clearly communicate the AI’s limitations and its evolving capabilities.

Technical Guidelines

1. Frontend Development
	•	Framework: Use React.js or a similar framework for a dynamic and responsive UI.
	•	Design:
	•	Follow the Tamagotchi-inspired theme with animations and progress indicators.
	•	Use libraries like Framer Motion for engaging visuals (e.g., egg cracking).
	•	Components:
	•	Egg Stage:
	•	Static page with a central graphic and email signup form.
	•	Hatchling Stage:
	•	Interactive form for data input with real-time feedback animations.
	•	Juvenile Stage:
	•	Chat interface with simple text input and response display.

2. Backend Development
	•	Infrastructure:
	•	Use Firebase, Supabase, or a lightweight Node.js server for data storage and user authentication.
	•	APIs:
	•	Connect to a pre-trained LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for Juvenile stage interactions.
	•	Database:
	•	Store user-provided data securely, ensuring it can be used later for fine-tuning the AI.

3. AI Integration
	•	Model Selection:
	•	Start with a pre-trained LLM such as OpenAI GPT-4 for basic text generation.
	•	Interactivity:
	•	Define clear prompt templates to ensure predictable outputs (e.g., “Write a tweet about [topic].”).
	•	Limitations:
	•	Implement guardrails to restrict responses to relevant, basic tasks.

4. Visual Feedback
	•	Use animations to represent growth and progress:
	•	Egg Stage: Static glowing egg.
	•	Hatchling Stage: Cracking or pulsing egg as users input data.
	•	Juvenile Stage: A small animated character responding to user interactions.

5. Deployment
	•	Hosting:
	•	Use Vercel or Netlify for the frontend.
	•	Deploy the backend on Heroku, Firebase Functions, or similar platforms.
	•	Domain:
	•	Secure a domain that aligns with the project branding.
	•	Versioning:
	•	Use Git for version control and CI/CD pipelines for smooth updates.

Process Guidelines

1. Planning
	•	Define the scope for each stage:
	•	Egg: Static content and signup.
	•	Hatchling: Basic data input and feedback.
	•	Juvenile: Chat interface and simple task execution.
	•	Map user flows for each stage.

2. Development
	•	Egg Stage:
	•	Build the static landing page and test responsiveness.
	•	Integrate email signup with tools like Mailchimp.
	•	Hatchling Stage:
	•	Create the data input form and ensure backend connectivity.
	•	Develop simple animations for feedback.
	•	Juvenile Stage:
	•	Implement the chatbot interface and connect it to the LLM API.
	•	Test input/output interactions for clarity and relevance.

3. Testing
	•	Functional Testing:
	•	Ensure each feature works as expected (e.g., form submissions, API responses).
	•	Usability Testing:
	•	Collect feedback on the UI/UX for improvements.
	•	Performance Testing:
	•	Test for responsiveness and scalability under expected loads.

4. Launch
	•	Deploy the Egg stage first to start building an audience.
	•	Gradually roll out the Hatchling and Juvenile stages as features are completed.

Security and Privacy Guidelines
	1.	Data Handling:
	•	Encrypt all user-provided data in transit and at rest.
	•	Clearly communicate data usage policies.
	2.	API Usage:
	•	Secure API keys and rate-limit requests to prevent abuse.
	3.	Compliance:
	•	Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant regulations.

Project Timeline

Week	Milestone
Week 1-2	Design the landing page (Egg stage).
Week 3-4	Implement the Hatchling stage (data input).
Week 5-6	Develop the Juvenile stage (chat interface).
Week 7+	Iterate and refine based on user feedback.

By following these guidelines, you can deliver a functional and scalable MVP while laying the groundwork for future enhancements. Let me know if you’d like additional details on any specific part!
